About the problem {PROBLEM=257}, I've already opened and issue about the formalization in Lean which I consider it plausible, however the logic of the solution in the manuscript ( can be found in <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/18273396" > the link </a>) as I could resume is the following:

For arbitrary subsets $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, we restructure the effective sum $S_{\star}$ by applying a double filtration based on arithmetic properties. We utilize the differential smoothness shells $\Delta \Psi_k$, determined by the largest prime factor $P(n)$, and the arithmetic complexity layers $\mathcal{S}_{k,j}$, determined by the total number of prime factors $\Omega(n)$.

The structural definitions are given by:
$$
\Delta \Psi_k = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} \mid P(n) = p_k \}
$$
$$
\mathcal{S}_{k,j} = \{ n \in \Delta \Psi_k \mid \Omega(n) = j \}
$$

Consequently, the sum $S_{\star}$ is reordered as a nested summation. We expand the reciprocal term $(b^n - 1)^{-1}$ into its constituent geometric series $\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} b^{-tn}$ to expose the distinct arithmetic frequencies:

$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{\star} &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \sum_{n \in A \cap \Delta \Psi_k} \frac{1}{b^n - 1} \\
&= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \sum_{n \in \mathcal{S}_{k,j}} \left( \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} b^{-tn} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

To formalize the expansion in the general case, we replace the multiplicative period growth of the coprime setting with a construction based on the Least Common Multiple (LCM), accommodating the shared factors of the smoothness shells.

We define the fundamental period at step $k$, denoted $L_k$, as the LCM of all active terms in the cumulative set $\mathcal{A}^{(k)} = \bigcup_{i=1}^k (A \cap \Delta \Psi_i)$:

$$
L_k = \operatorname{lcm} \left( \mathcal{A}^{(k)} \right) = \operatorname{lcm}(L_{k-1}, \operatorname{lcm}(A \cap \Delta \Psi_k))
$$

The transition from $L_{k-1}$ to $L_k$ implies a geometric expansion of the period. The number of sub-blocks required to cover the new period is given by the integer ratio $\mu_k$:

$$
\mu_k = \frac{L_k}{L_{k-1}}
$$

The construction of the new integer block $C_k$ proceeds by iterating through the sub-block index $q \in \{1, \dots, \mu_k\}$. For each segment, we inject the Generalized Perturbation Block $B^{\Psi}_{k,q}$, which represents the integer projection of the sum of all new terms in the current shell $\Delta \Psi_k$ (including the Witness $n^*$ and the noise).

The recursive update rule for the $q$-th augmented sub-block is under ideal conditions:

$$
C'_{k,q} = C_{k-1} + B^{\Psi}_{k,q} \pmod{b^{L_{k-1}}}
$$

Here, $B^{\Psi}_{k,q}$ is defined by the fractional extraction of the shell sum $S_{\Delta \Psi_k}$ aligned to the window $q$:

$$
B^{\Psi}_{k,q} = \left\lfloor b^{L_{k-1}} \cdot \left\{ S_{\Delta \Psi_k} \cdot b^{(q-1)L_{k-1}} \right\} \right\rfloor
$$

This structure ensures that the global period $C_k$ is formed by the concatenation of these $\mu_k$ distinct sub-blocks, where the distinctness is guaranteed by the dominant valuation of the Witness term within $B^{\Psi}_{k,q}$.

We now quantify the total volume of arithmetic carries generated by the superposition of the terms derived above. A structural carry occurs at a position $x$ if the collision multiplicity, defined as the sum of active indicators from the geometric series, exceeds the base capacity:

$$
\nu(x) = \sum_{k, n, t} \mathbb{1}_{\{t \cdot n = x\}} > 1
$$

To bound this strictly, we calculate the Carry Interference Load, denoted $\mathcal{H}(n)$. This metric represents the maximum number of periodic sub-blocks in the expansion of $L_k$ that a single term $n$ can structurally compromise.

Using the valuation decomposition $n = p_k^{\nu_k(n)} \cdot m_n$, the logarithmic displacement (the "danger zone" of the carry) scales linearly with the valuation:

$$
\mathcal{M}(n) \approx \log_b(n) = \nu_k(n) \log_b(p_k) + \log_b(m_n)
$$

To quantify the stability of the expansion, we aggregate all potential carry propagation events into a discrete metric we term "carry interference tokens," denoted by $|\mathbb{U}_{haz}|$. This total quantity serves as the critical discriminator for structural integrity. The proof of irrationality rests on the simultaneous satisfaction of three rigid arithmetic conditions derived from the density bounds:

1. Stable Periodic Representation ($0.\overline{C}$):
The asymptotic vanishing of the interference density, $\mathcal{I}_{total} \to 0$, guarantees that the integer boundary is preserved. The tail carry never propagates to the integer part, ensuring the partial sum admits the exact representation:
$$
S_k = 0.\overline{C_k}
$$
where $C_k$ is a rigid integer block of length $L_{k-1}$.

2. The Broken Carry-Border Bijection:
The mapping from the set of interference tokens to the block boundaries is non-surjective. Since $|\mathbb{U}_{haz}| \ll \mu_k$, the bijection between potential carries and block borders is broken. The carry mechanism lacks the cardinality to mask the structural borders of the majority of sub-blocks, leaving the geometric segmentation intact.

3. Universal Distinctness via the Witness Term:
The Witness term $n^*$ injects a dominant $p$-adic valuation that induces a strict phase shift $z_q$. Because the carry interference is topologically confined (Condition 2), it cannot wash out this signal. Consequently, every valid sub-block possesses a unique signature:
$$
\forall q_1 \neq q_2, \quad C'_{k, q_1} \neq C'_{k, q_2}
$$

Conclusion: Denominator Growth and Absence of Simplification

Since all sub-blocks $C'_{k,q}$ are distinct, the base-$b$ expansion contains no repeating subsequences within the period $L_k$. Therefore, the Ordinal Simplification mechanism (which permits a rational period to be smaller than the block length, $P < L_k$) is blocked.

The fundamental period cannot collapse:
$$
\operatorname{ord}_b(\text{denom}(S_k)) = L_k
$$
As $k \to \infty$, $L_k$ grows indefinitely. Consequently, the denominator of the rational approximation grows without bound, proving that $S$ cannot converge to a rational number with a finite denominator.

The total quantity of carry interference tokens, $\mathbb{U}_{haz}$, is the summation of these displacements over the expansion factor $\mu_k$:

$$
|\mathbb{U}_{haz}| = \sum_{n \in A \cap \Delta \Psi_k} \mathcal{H}(n) \approx \sum_{n \in A_k} \left( \mu_k \cdot \frac{\mathcal{M}(n)}{n} \right)
$$
Substituting the valuation form into the density, we observe that the high-valuation terms (the Witness candidates) are naturally suppressed by their own magnitude. Applying the Euler product analysis for the shell sums, we obtain the strict asymptotic bound:

$$
\frac{|\mathbb{U}_{haz}|}{\mu_k} \le \sum_{n \in A_k} \frac{\nu_k(n) \log_b(p_k) + \log_b(m_n)}{p_k^{\nu_k(n)} \cdot m_n} = \mathcal{O} \left( \frac{(\ln p_k)^2}{p_k} \right)
$$
Since the denominator grows exponentially with respect to the valuation $\nu_k(n)$ while the numerator grows only linearly, the sequence converges to zero. This implies that the set of blocks corrupted by carries is asymptotically negligible.

We isolate the structural contribution of the Witness Term $n^*$ to the $q$-th sub-block. The injection position $z_q$ is determined by the phase shift of the geometric border relative to the arithmetic period $n^*$:

$$
z_q \equiv q \cdot L_{k-1} \pmod{n^*}
$$

The integer value of the Witness Block, denoted $B^*_{q}$, is strictly defined by this residue. It represents a single $p$-adic spike projected into the integer domain:

$$
B^*_{q} = b^{L_{k-1} - z_q}
$$

To verify that this signal remains detectable, we analyze its superposition with the accumulated background block $C_{k-1}$. The crucial observation is that the partial sum $S_{k-1}$ converges to a value strictly bounded away from unity (derived from the Erd\H{o}s-Borwein constant limit):

$$
S_{k-1} = \frac{C_{k-1}}{b^{L_{k-1}} - 1} < 1 - \epsilon
$$

This implies that the integer block $C_{k-1}$ is not saturated; it contains a density of zeros sufficient to absorb perturbations. When combining the background with the witness, the logarithmic magnitude of the augmented block $C'_{q}$ decouples:

$$
\log_b(C'_{q}) = \log_b(C_{k-1} + B^*_{q}) \approx L_{k-1} + \log_b(S_{k-1})
$$

Since $\log_b(S_{k-1}) < 0$, the background $C_{k-1}$ effectively acts as a magnitude scaling factor strictly less than the block capacity $L_{k-1}$. Consequently, the addition of $B^*_{q}$ generates a carry interference $\delta_{add}$ that is logarithmically confined:

$$
\delta_{add} = \log_b \left( 1 + \frac{B^*_{q}}{C_{k-1}} \right) \ll L_{k-1}
$$

Therefore, the background $C_{k-1}$ lacks the arithmetic density required to bridge the gap between distinct witness phases via carry propagation. The structural signature of $z_q$ is preserved in $C'_{q}$, ensuring distinctness.

Finally, we establish the irrationality of $S_{\star}$, specilly if the subset is supported by a finite set of primes, through an inductive argument on the valuation tower of the supernatural period $\mathcal{L}$. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the sum is rational with a fundamental period $T$. Since the subset $A$ is infinite, there exists a prime $p$ such that the sequence of valuations $V_k = v_p(L_k)$ diverges to infinity.

We proceed by induction on the step $k$. For a sufficiently large $k$, the valuation of the constructed period exceeds that of the candidate: $V_{k+1} > V_k \ge v_p(T)$. The injection of the Witness term $n^*$ at step $k+1$ imposes a strict phase shift condition modulo $p^{V_{k+1}}$. However, the candidate period $T$ is invariant only under shifts compatible with its fixed valuation $v_p(T)$. As $V_k$ ascends the tower, the phase shift induced by the Witness becomes orthogonal to the invariance group of $T$. Consequently, the profinite limit $\lim_{k \to \infty} S_k$ cannot stabilize to a rational value, as no finite integer $T$ can satisfy the synchronization requirements of the diverging witness frequencies in the $p$-adic topology.
